### NativeScript SideDrawer App

This is a basic example of the {NS} RadSideDrawer in Angular2, combined with an ActionBar and minimal styling. 

I built this small example as I had some issues with getting Angular2 routes, RadSideDrawer and child pages working together and there were no real clear Angular2 examples out there with this combination.

I also put tons of logging in for both my benefit and yours (if you're new to this as I was), cause it really helped with understanding what happened and when.
